Email claims to be from "PayPal Support <support@paypall.com>" with the subject:  
*"Important: Your Account is on Hold â€“ Action Required Immediately"*

## ðŸš© Identified Phishing Indicators:

   - SPF: Fail  
   - DKIM: Not Signed  
   - DMARC: Fail  
   - Return-path domain does not match "From" domain.

   - Subject and body had phrases like "verify now", "your account will be suspended", which is a known phishing tactic.

4. *Suspicious URL:*
   - The button/link was labeled "Restore Account" but on hover, it was redirecting to:  
     http://paypal.verify-user-service-login.com/reset
   - This is not an official PayPal domain.

6. *No Personalized Info:*

## âœ… Conclusion:

This email shows clear signs of phishing:
- Fake sender address
